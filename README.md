### Introduction

Cell Count is designed to count the number of cells in an image that the user inputs.
The goal of this project effficiency and accuracy in wet labs that use hemocytometers to count cells. This project was part of our semester project for BME3053C, a computer appliations for Biomedical Engineering class at the University of Florida.

Technologies: MATLAB, Kaggle (testing database)

### Launch
Note: Photos must be in same directory as the code for CellCount to run. The file name must be inputted when the program asks for it.
Example Input: "image1.jgp"

### SetUp
To use this code, simply download it and run it using MATLAB. MAKE SURE THE DESIRED IMAGE YOU WANT TO ANALYZE IS IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THE PROGRAM
